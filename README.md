# Signage_Board_Information_Recognition
The aim of the project is to detect traffic signs present on the sidelines of the road. At this time, I hae considred using static images and tested successfully on them. 

The project was done as a part of the course "Image Processing and Computer Vision".

I have developed the code in MATLAB and tried, implemented Feature detection and Segmentation Algorithms.

Further details and screenshots can be found in the report.

# To check the work flow of the code
1. Load the given images,audio file contained in "Test Images" or your downloaded images into the folder where you are going to test the work.
2. Download the code contained in "Source Code" Folder into the directory, images are presnet.
2. Edit the third line of the Signange_Board_Detection.m file, as per the image you want to experiment.
3. Since It is connected to all other pieces of work, just hitting run on the Signange_Board_Detection.m is sufficient.
4. View the different figures generated. Title on every image describes the image in brief.
5. Unmute the audio connection to check the system has issued warning.(Do not forget to download the audio file before running the code).
